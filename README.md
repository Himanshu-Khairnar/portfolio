# Protfoilo Webiste : Terminal Based

This is a **terminal-style portfolio website** built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**, inspired by the look and feel of a Linux terminal.  
Instead of a traditional portfolio with static pages, users can interact with the site using **commands** just like in a command-line interface.  




## Features

- Interactive **command-line interface** (type `help` to see available commands).  
- **ASCII banner** greeting and system info (OS, Kernel, Host, etc.).  
- Commands to explore:  
  - `aboutme` â†’ Learn more about me.  
  - `projects` â†’ View my highlighted projects.  
  - `experience` â†’ Check out my professional background.  
  - `education` â†’ See my academic history.  
  - `skills` â†’ My technical skills.  
  - `social` â†’ Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.  
  - `resume` â†’ Download my resume directly.  
  - `clear` â†’ Clear the terminal screen.  
- Deployed and hosted on **Vercel**.  
- Minimal and lightweight design with **blinking cursor effect** for real terminal vibes.  

ðŸš€ This portfolio not only showcases my **projects** and **skills**, but also reflects my **creativity and love for Linux/terminal environments**.
